	Greetings, visitor, to  XCC-P5831! As you may know, this outpost was once \
	used as Nanotrasen's CENTRAL COMMAND STATION, organizing and coordinating company \
	projects across the vastness of space. <br>\
	Since the completion of the much more efficient CC-A5831 on March 8, 2553, XCC-P5831 no longer \
	acts as NT's base of operations but still plays a very important role its corporate affairs.<br> \

	Hey, Rolf, as you may know, SS13 will be coming near your orbit soon. \
	After that catastrophe with the gateway, we would like to get some revenge on them. \
	So, I've had the team send you a giant laser pointer, military grade. \
	Go ahead and mount it in your observatory so you can point \
	it at their escape shuttle's pilot's eyes, maybe it will cost them a few credits. \
	- D. Cereza"
